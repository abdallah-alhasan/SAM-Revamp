                    Should I be qualified to join The 1 Million Peso Shootout Challenge, I hereby adhere to:
                    • Attend the finale of The 1 Million Peso Shootout Challenge on 4th March at Souk Al Marfa
                    • Present proof of identification – residence visa, Emirates ID or valid passport
                    • Understand that only 40 players can participate in the challenge
                    • During my turn, I need to pick one spot beyond the 14-meter half basketball court and from that specific spot, shoot the ball twice. The first player to make two successful shots wins the 1 million peso or AED 70,000 dirham prize.
                    
                    In case of a win, ARN and 5th Consulting DMCC will conduct necessary verification before awarding the cash prize.</p>
